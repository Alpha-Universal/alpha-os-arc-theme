Description: Arc theme built from GitHub for Ubuntu 16.04
 This package was created to work around the security concerns of an expired 
 GPG key used to sign the official Arc OBS repo. The key has been expired
 for 5 months as of November 2017
 .
 The original maintainer hasn't been heard from since that time, so this package
 will include all forked changes until the new maintainer returns, or until
 Ubuntu 18.04 is released.
